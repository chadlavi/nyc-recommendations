# Recommendations for visiting friends
When you live in a city like New York, people who are visiting from elsewhere often ask, *"where should we go?"*

To be honest, it's hard to answer that question on the spot. For one thing, New York City is a microcosmic reflection of the whole world. Whatever you want to eat, there is a place that does it well. Whatever culture you want to go get lost in, there's a place where you can do that. For another thing, people who live in New York (normal people, anyway) are just like you: we go to work, we hurry home, we watch TV in our sweatpants and repeat it all tomorrow. So the chances that one of us knows good places to go when visiting are much lower than, say, the chances that we have a good notion of what subway and/or bus will take you there, once we know the address.

So I figured, *"why not start some sort of actual list for this?"*. And here it is. Now when someone asks me, I can send them a link to this, and say, "I don't know; ask past me. He was much smarter than I am."

## Food
### Pizza
Brooklyn:
* [Best Pizza](http://www.best.piz.za.com), 33 Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg
	> My favorite pizza place in the world. Literally. They don't fuck around with a good thing. Well-executed New York brick oven pizza without a lot of fanfare. Apparently started by a Roberta's alum.
* [Roberta's](http://robertaspizza.com), 261 Moore Street, Bushwick
	> Something of a mecca for hipster pizza perfection. Roberta's gets really busy during popular hours, and chances are most of the other diners will be tourists. But damn if they don't do a great job. Note that Roberta's makes 30cm-ish personal-size pies, and you may experience some sticker shock. Get the garlic knots when you're there; they're basically garlicky croissants.

Manhattan:
* [Prince Street Pizza](http://princestpizzanewyork.com), 27 Prince Street, SoHo

### Bagels
Brooklyn:
* [The Bagel Store](http://thebagelstoreonline.com), 754 Metropolitan Avenue, East Williamsburg
	> This is my local bagel shop. Much to my chagrin, they've caught something of a tourism following with a real piece of nonsense, the "Rainbow Bagel". Do not eat this abomination. It's a gimick, and I resent it; but their real bagels are great. Get a bacon, egg and cheese on an untoasted everything bagel. Get a half dozen bagels and some schmear to go, and eat them late at night.
* [Bagelsmith](http://bagelsmith.com), 566 Lorimer Street, Williamsburg
	> A very similar place to The Bagel Store, but somewhat less plagued by tourists. Line moves quickly.

Manhattan:
* [Black Seed Bagels](https://www.blackseedbagels.com), 176 1st Avenue, East Village
	> High-quality Montreal-Style bagels.
* [Barney Greengrass](https://www.barneygreengrass.com), 541 Amsterdam Avenue, Upper West Side
* [Murray's Bagels](http://www.murraysbagels.com), 500 6th Avenue, Greenwich Village

### Dim Sum
* [Golden Unicorn](http://goldenunicornnyc.com), 18 East Broadway, Chinatown
	> A great classic Dim Sum house. Expect a wait on weekends at brunch time, but it's not too long before you'll be up the elevator and nodding as wave after wave of dim sum carts fill your passport to Fattown. Favorite spot of friends of Andre.
### Korean
* [Jongro BBQ](http://jongrobbqny.com), 22 West 32nd Street, 2nd floor, Ktown
	> You walk up to the door and you think, *"surely I'm at the wrong address."* Don't worry you're not. It looks like the lobby of a small-potatoes office building, but Jongro is really here, on the second floor. The interior is a sort of Korean BBQ Disneyland, with fake building façades. If you're not sure how Korean BBQ works, read this: https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/korean-bbq-how-to-order-eat. It's great.

## Bars
### Beer
Brooklyn:
* [Tørst](http://torstnyc.com), 615 Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint
* [Greenpoint Beer and Ale](http://greenpointbeer.com), 7 North 15th Street, Greenpoint

### Cocktails
Brooklyn:
* [Night of Joy](http://nightofjoybar.com), 667 Lorimer Street, Williamsburg
* [Hotel Delmano](http://hoteldelmano.com), 82 Berry Street, Williamsburg
* [Larry Lawrence](http://larrylawrencebar.com), 295 Grand Street, South Williamsburg
	> Speak-easy.

Manhattan:
* [Pegu Club](http://www.peguclub.com/), 77 West Houston, West Village
	> You're walking along a pretty generic looking strip of Houston street, mostly full of furniture, kitchen and bath showrooms. *This* is where this bar is? Yes, it is. The Pegu Club is basically invisible from the street, as it's upstairs from a not-too-noticeable door. But once you're in, it feels like you've stepped into a different world. The interior is a mix of midcentury modern, Orient Express, and Raymond Chandler chic. Also, more importantly, the booze is damn good. This is one of those bars where you can tell them the feel you're going for, and they'll make you a cocktail. Favorite spot of friends of Andre.

## Coffee
Brooklyn:
* Tarpit Coffee, 135 Woodpoint Rd, East Williamsburg
	> High-quality artisan coffee drinks, and excellent baked goods.
* [Variety Coffee](https://varietycoffeeroasters.com), 368 Graham Avenue, East Williamsburg
	> My local coffee shop. A reliable morning friend.
* [Oslo](http://oslocoffee.com), 133 Roebling Street, Williamsburg
	> I go out of my way to buy beans from this place; they're what I drink at home.
